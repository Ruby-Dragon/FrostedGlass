						<p>This is a website styling framework that uses lots of transparency. It is designed to look modern and easy to use.</p>
						<p>These styles are free to use under the GPL licence.</p>
						<p>More information can be found below, in the LICENCE file, and in the Readme.md file.</p>
						<p>Read the source HTML code for examples of how to use the stylesheets.</p>
						<p>This description box is recommended to be smaller than the screen size and is intended for breif descriptions. It can be made smaller, larger, or even used repeatedly!</p>
						<p>Be careful to use sizes correctly so that the boxes are filled in a way that feels correct to the end user!</p>

				<p>This is where you put more detailed information.</p>
				<p>This stylesheet set has multiple "Themes", which each look different. Currently, only the "Forest" theme is officially supported, and may be worked on more later,
				but custom themes can be made by editing the colors in the stylesheets.</p>

				<p>Use this theme by linking the stylesheets into your own HTML and using the CSS classes defined there. Use the HTML files here 	as examples to guide your own site! You can make your own HTML or modify this code. I am not interested in making pages for very specific features or for signup/login, so you will have to make those yourself.</p>

				<p>An important thing to keep in mind, is that the blur effect is not currently supported on Firefox (97, at time of writing). This may change in the future, but keep in mind when creating your own themes that the site needs to look good even without the blur effect.</p>

				<h3>This is a subsection header!</h3>
				<p>Subsections are used to help group topics together</p>
				<p>All text here should be about subsections, because that is what the header is about!</p>

				<h3>External Libraries:</h3>
				<p>I am trying to reduce or eliminate external CSS/JS/Fonts used in this theme. I will try to have as many required resources included in this repo as I can. Fonts, images, and css are usually easy to keep as files within this repo, but JS has a lot of libraries. I will do my best to either make my own solution, or include library files inside the repo.</p>
