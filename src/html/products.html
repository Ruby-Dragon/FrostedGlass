						<h2>Products!</h2>
						<p>This is where you can put products or projects to show off.</p>
						<p>Each Product has its own box. The entire box is the link to that specific product's page. When hovered, the box gets darker and grows slightly to indicate that it is selected. When clicked, it will open the specific page for that product.</p>
						<p>Add as many products as you want, and edit their content to whatever you want.</p>
						<p>These products do not have to be used for products, they can also be used for projects in a portfolio, basically whatever you want to have in a list of links to other specific pages.</p>
						<p>Utilizing a search feature would be ideal if you have enough products here to make the user experience easier.</p>
