						<h2>Description!</h2>
						<p>This is a website styling framework that uses lots of transparency. It is designed to look modern and easy to use.</p>
						<p>These styles are free to use under the GPL licence.</p>
						<p>More information can be found below, in the LICENCE file, and in the Readme.md file.</p>
						<p>Read the source HTML code for examples of how to use the stylesheets.</p>
						<p>This description box is recommended to be smaller than the screen size and is intended for breif descriptions. It can be made smaller, larger, or even used repeatedly!</p>
						<p>Be careful to use sizes correctly so that the boxes are filled in a way that feels correct to the end user!</p>

				<h2 class = "sectionHeader">More information here!</h2>
				<p>This is where you put more detailed information.</p>
				<p>This stylesheet set has multiple "Themes", which each look different. Currently, only the "Forest" theme is supported,
				but custom themes can be made by editing the colors in the stylesheets.</p>

				<p>Use this theme by linking the stylesheets into your own HTML and using the CSS classes defined here. Use the HTML files here 	as examples to guide your own site!</p>

				<p>An important thing to keep in mind, is that the blur effect is not currently supported on Firefox (97, at time of writing). This may change in the future, but keep in mind when creating your own themes that the site needs to look good even without the blur effect.</p>

				<h3>This is a subsection header!</h3>
				<p>Subsections are used to help group topics together</p>
				<p>All text here should be about subsections, because that is what the header is about!</p>
